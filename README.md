# JustDrawLib
A Simple, Header-Only, Object-Oriented Extention to the SDL2 library for drawing circles, triangles, and other types of polygons.
Both outlines and filled algorithms are provided for all shapes.

This "Library" takes an "include what you need" approach. Please check out the Shapes.h file to understand how all other classes work.
Everything, except for Vertice.h builds on top of it.
